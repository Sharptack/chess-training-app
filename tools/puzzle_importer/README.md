# Puzzle Importer Tool

This tool imports puzzles from the Lichess puzzle database and filters them by level themes and rating.

## Available Tools

This package includes three tools for different workflows:

| Tool | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **import_puzzles.py** | Import from Lichess database | Finding high-quality puzzles by theme/rating |
| **review_ui_with_editor.html** | Review & edit candidates | Selecting best 15 from candidates, minor edits |
| **puzzle_creator.html** | Create custom puzzles | Building puzzles from scratch, major edits |

## Quick Start

```bash
cd tools/puzzle_importer

# 1. Install dependencies (first time only)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Generate puzzle candidates
python3 import_puzzles.py

# 3. Review and edit puzzles
./open_editor.sh

# OR: Create puzzles from scratch
open ../puzzle_reviewer/puzzle_creator.html

## Setup

1. Install required Python packages:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip3 install pandas python-chess
```

2. Make sure `lichess_db_puzzle.csv` is in this directory

## Usage

### Step 1: Import Candidate Puzzles

Run the import script to generate candidate puzzles for each level:

```bash
cd tools/puzzle_importer
python3 import_puzzles.py
```

This will:
- Load the Lichess puzzle database (5.4M puzzles)
- Filter puzzles for each level based on:
  - **Rating range**: 600-800 (beginner level)
  - **Themes**: Level-specific tactical patterns
  - **Popularity**: High-quality puzzles ranked first
- Generate up to 50 candidates per level
- Save results to `output/level_XXXX_candidates.json`

### Step 2: Review and Select Puzzles

1. Open the review UI in your browser:
```bash
# Option 1: Quick script (shows helpful paths)
./open_review.sh

# Option 2: Direct open (basic review)
open ../puzzle_reviewer/review_ui.html

# Option 3: With editing features (RECOMMENDED)
open ../puzzle_reviewer/review_ui_with_editor.html
```

**âœ¨ NEW: Editor Features**
- Visual chessboard showing puzzle position
- Edit FEN position, moves, or hint
- Changes tracked and included in export
- Can export all puzzles with edits

2. Click "Choose File" and navigate to the output directory:
   - The file picker opens in Downloads by default
   - Navigate to: `chess-training-app/tools/puzzle_importer/output/`
   - Select a candidate file (e.g., `level_0001_candidates.json`)

   **Tip**: The full path is `/Users/[YourName]/chess-training-app/tools/puzzle_importer/output/`

3. Review each puzzle:
   - Click "View on Lichess" to see the puzzle on Lichess (opens in new tab)
   - Study the FEN, solution, themes, and rating
   - Click "Select" to add to your final selection (card turns green)
4. Select 15 puzzles per level (counter shows in top-right)
5. Click "Export Selected Puzzles" to download the final JSON
   - File saves to your Downloads folder as `selected_puzzles.json`
6. Rename and move the exported file:
```bash
# Example: Move and rename for level 1
mv ~/Downloads/selected_puzzles.json ../../assets/data/puzzles/puzzles_level_0001.json
```

```python
"level_0001": {
    "title": "Your Level Title",
    "themes": ["theme1", "theme2", "theme3"],  # Lichess theme tags
    "rating_range": [600, 800],                # Min/max rating
    "max_candidates": 50,                       # How many candidates to generate
    "notes": "Description of what this level focuses on"
}
```

### Available Lichess Themes

Common themes you can use:
- **Checkmates**: `mate`, `mateIn1`, `mateIn2`, `backRankMate`, `smotheredMate`
- **Tactics**: `fork`, `pin`, `skewer`, `discoveredAttack`, `doubleCheck`
- **Piece-specific**: `queenEndgame`, `rookEndgame`, `bishopEndgame`, `knightEndgame`, `pawnEndgame`
- **Concepts**: `promotion`, `castling`, `enPassant`, `sacrifice`, `defensiveMove`

## Output Format

Final puzzle JSON format:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "puzzle_00008",
    "fen": "r6k/pp2r2p/4Rp1Q/3p4/8/1N1P2R1/PqP2bPP/7K b - - 0 24",
    "moveSequence": ["f2g3", "e6e7", "b2b1", "b3c1", "b1c1", "h6c1"],
    "hint": "Checkmate in two moves!"
  }
]
```

## Tips

- **Too few candidates?** Broaden the theme list or increase rating range
- **Too many candidates?** Make themes more specific or narrow rating range
- **Wrong difficulty?** Adjust the rating_range (lower = easier)
- **Quality issues?** The script sorts by popularity, so top results should be good

## Next Steps

After selecting puzzles for levels 1-10, add more level definitions to `LEVEL_THEMES` and repeat the process!
