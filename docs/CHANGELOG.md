- Clean, compact display integrated into GameView

**3. Starting Position/Restriction Preview** üîç ‚úÖ
- Visual badges in bot selector showing game features:
  - üîµ "Custom position" badge for startingFen
  - üü£ "Move restrictions" badge for allowedMoves
- Helps users understand game type before starting
- No full board preview needed - badges sufficient

**4. Bot Move Restrictions (Enhanced)** ü§ñ ‚úÖ
- Bot now follows allowedMoves restrictions same as human
- Deterministic behavior (plays first allowed move, not random)
- Example: Italian Opening bot forces BOTH players to follow sequence
- Updated bot_004_opening: e4/e5, Nf3/Nc6, Bc4/Bc5

**5. JSON Schema Documentation** üìã ‚úÖ
- Created bot.schema.json with all fields documented
- Created bots.schema.json for bot collections
- Enables IDE autocomplete and validation
- Includes examples and descriptions for all fields

**Files Modified (Rounds 1 & 2)**: 17 total files
- 4 model/logic files (game_state, bot, boss, game_view)
- 3 UI files (play_page, boss_page, bot_selector_page)
- 1 config file (bots.json)
- 2 new schema files (bot.schema.json, bots.schema.json)

### Testing Results ‚úÖ ALL TESTS PASSED

- ‚úÖ Progress updates immediately after game completion
- ‚úÖ Progress persists across app restarts
- ‚úÖ Level completion badge shows correctly (green checkmark)
- ‚úÖ Bot selector shows individual bot progress with checkmarks

**UI/UX:**

- ‚úÖ Resigned games don't count toward progress
- ‚úÖ Undo button works correctly (disabled when no moves to undo)
- ‚úÖ Move history panel displays all moves

**Backwards Compatibility:**

- ‚úÖ All previous progress preserved

### Bugs Fixed During Testing
1. **Move restrictions validated after move was made** ‚Üí Fixed: Now validates BEFORE move

## Phase 7.2: Campaign Unlocking ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Branch**: phase-7.2-campaign-unlocking
**Merged**: October 14, 2025
**Focus**: Campaign unlock system and simplified boss requirements

### Implemented
- Campaign-level boss progress tracking (not level-level)

## Phase 8: Game Types System ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Branch**: phase-8-game-types
**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Focus**: Support multiple game types beyond bot games (e.g., puzzle-style games)

### Implemented
- **Game Types Architecture**: Extensible system for different game types within levels
- **Check vs Checkmate Game**: Quiz-style game where students identify check or checkmate positions
- **Progress Tracking**: Complete progress system for non-bot games
- **Unified Game Selector**: Shows all game types together (bots + puzzle games)

### New Game: Check vs Checkmate
- Display chess position (read-only board)
- Two buttons: "‚úì Check" and "# Checkmate"
- 20 positions with instant feedback
- Progress bar showing position X/20
- Completion tracking with score display
- Data file: assets/data/games/check_checkmate_positions.json (20 FEN positions)

### Technical Changes

#### New Models
- **game.dart**: Game model with GameType enum (bot, checkCheckmate)
  - Fields: id, type, completionsRequired, botId (for bot games), positionIds (for position-based games)
  - Extensible for future game types
- **game_progress.dart**: Progress tracking for non-bot games (completions, completionsRequired, timestamps)
- **check_checkmate_position.dart**: Position model (id, fen, answer, description)

#### Updated Models
- **level.dart**:
  - Added `games` array field (List<Game>)
  - Maintains backward compatibility with `playBotIds` array
  - Automatically converts old botIds format to new games format

#### New Features
- **features/games/check_checkmate/**: Complete game implementation
  - pages/check_checkmate_page.dart
  - models/check_checkmate_position.dart
  - Read-only chess board with view-only mode

#### Repository Updates
- **progress_repository.dart**:
  - `getGameProgress(gameId, completionsRequired)` - Fetch game progress
  - `recordGameCompletion(gameId, completionsRequired)` - Save completion

#### Provider Updates
- **providers.dart**:
  - `gameProgressProvider` - FutureProvider.family for non-bot game progress
  - Updated `playProgressProvider` to check BOTH bot games AND other game types
  - Now properly calculates level completion based on all game types

#### UI Updates
- **game_selector_page.dart**:
  - Supports multiple game types in one list
  - Shows game type label ("Bot" vs "Puzzle")
  - Different card styles per game type
  - Progress display for all game types
- **play_page.dart**: Loads bots from both playBotIds and games array
- **chess_board_widget.dart**: Added view-only mode (disable piece movement when onMoveMade is null)

### Level Configuration Format
```json
{
  "play": {
    "botIds": ["bot_001", "bot_002"],  // Legacy, still supported
    "gamesRequired": 1,                // Legacy
    "games": [                         // New format
      {
        "id": "game_check_checkmate_level_0001",
        "type": "check_checkmate",
        "positionIds": [1, 2, 3, ..., 20],
        "completionsRequired": 1
      },
      {
        "id": "game_bot_001",
        "type": "bot",
        "botId": "bot_001",
        "completionsRequired": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
