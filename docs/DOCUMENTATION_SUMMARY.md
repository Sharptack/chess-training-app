## Phase Numbering Alignment

### CHANGELOG.md (Historical)
- Phase 0: Foundation
- Phase 0.5: Content Loading
- Phase 1: Video Lessons
- Phase 2: Chessboard Foundation
- Phase 2.5: Chess Engine Integration
- Phase 2.7: Visual Polish
- Phase 3: Interactive Puzzles

- Phase 5: Stockfish Integration
- Phase 6: Boss Battle & Unlock
- Phase 6.5: Code Quality & Polish

## Branch Naming Patterns

### Phase 7 (Current)
```
phase-7.1-campaign-system
phase-7.2-unlock-system
phase-7.3-mobile-responsive
phase-7.4-content-creation
phase-7.5-analytics
phase-7.6-polish
phase-7.7-launch
```

### Post-Phase 7 (Future)
```
feature/spaced-repetition
feature/scrollable-move-history
feature/goal-based-games
feature/timed-puzzle-rush
feature/custom-bot-ai
etc.
```

## Key Design Decisions Captured

### "Games" not "Bots"
- Terminology changed throughout all docs
- Encompasses: full games, endgame practice, opening practice, future features
- 1-5 games per level (flexible)
- Each game has `type` and `completionsRequired`

### Campaign Structure
- 14 campaigns (13 active + 1 reserved)
- 55 levels total
- Variable campaign sizes (3-6 levels)
- Bosses at campaign level (not level level)
- Unlock progression: Level ‚Üí Level ‚Üí Boss ‚Üí Next Campaign

### Three Game Types
1. **full_game**: Standard bot game, full starting position
2. **endgame_practice**: Custom FEN, practice specific scenarios
3. **opening_practice**: Move restrictions, learn opening sequences

### VideoPlayerView Issue
- Identified as redundant with LessonPlayer widget in lesson_page.dart
- Scheduled for deletion in Phase 7.6 code cleanup
- Already noted in LAUNCH_PLAN.md and ARCHITECTURE.md

### Metrics Tracking (Phase 7.5)
All requested metrics included:
- Engagement: DAU/WAU, session frequency, session length, onboarding completion
- Progress: Lesson/puzzle/game completion rates, campaign funnel, boss win rate
- Drop-off: Skip rate, quit points, feature usage breakdown
- Qualitative: NPS from parents, feedback forms

---

## No More Overlap

**Before**: PROGRESS.md had detailed historical phases (duplicated CHANGELOG.md)
**After**: PROGRESS.md is simple status hub, CHANGELOG.md has all history

**Before**: LAUNCH_PLAN.md had full campaign/level breakdown
**After**: CAMPAIGN_STRUCTURE.md has content details, LAUNCH_PLAN.md has implementation plan

**Before**: Unclear which document to reference
**After**: Clear hierarchy and purpose for each document

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review LAUNCH_PLAN.md** - Confirm phase breakdown makes sense
2. **Review CAMPAIGN_STRUCTURE.md** - Verify all 13 campaigns are correct
3. **Start Phase 7.1** - Begin campaign system implementation
4. **Use branch naming**: `git checkout -b phase-7.1-campaign-system`

---

## After Phase 7 Complete

1. **Add to CHANGELOG.md**:
```markdown
## Phase 7: Chess Club Launch Preparation ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Branches**: phase-7.1 through phase-7.7
**Date**: [Date range]
**Focus**: Campaign restructure, content creation, analytics, chess club launch

### Implemented
- Campaign system with 13 campaigns, 55 levels
- Games architecture (full_game, endgame_practice, opening_practice)
- 55 video lessons, 550+ puzzles, 100-150 games
- Analytics tracking (DAU/WAU, NPS, funnel, skip rate)
- Mobile deployment (iOS TestFlight, Android Internal Testing)
- Chess club launch with 5-10 students

[... details ...]
```

2. **Delete LAUNCH_PLAN.md** - No longer needed
3. **Work from BACKLOG.md** - Prioritize Tier 1 features
4. **Switch to feature branches** - `feature/spaced-repetition`, etc.

---

## Questions Answered

‚úÖ **Phase numbering aligned**: Continues from 6.7 ‚Üí 7 (7.1-7.7)
‚úÖ **Branch names added**: Clear pattern for Phase 7
