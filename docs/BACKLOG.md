## üéØ Post-MVP Features (Phase 10+)

### Full Spaced Repetition System (Phase 7.3)
**Priority**: High
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

**Description**:
Complete adaptive spaced repetition with SM-2 or FSRS algorithm for optimal memory retention.

**Requirements**:
- Cumulative puzzle pools (Level 3 includes all puzzles from L1-L3)
- Score threshold requirements (80%+ accuracy to pass)
- Interval-based review scheduling (1, 3, 7, 14, 30 days)
- Session-based puzzle queue (10-15 puzzles per session)
- Progress toward threshold UI: "24/30 correct - 80%"

**Models Needed**:
- `PuzzleSchedule` - nextReviewDate, easeFactor, intervalDays
- Enhanced `PuzzlePerformance` with time-decay factors

**Challenges**:
- Potential frustration for struggling learners (never-ending review loops)
- Extensive playtesting needed for difficulty calibration
- Balance between challenge and engagement

### Cloud Video Storage Migration üé•
**Priority**: Medium
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks
**Status**: Deferred from Phase 6.7

**When to Implement**:
- App bundle size exceeds 100MB (App Store warnings)
- Have 10+ hours of video content
- Need frequent video updates
- Ready to invest in infrastructure

**Infrastructure**:
- **Cloudflare R2** (recommended): $0.015/GB storage, ZERO egress fees
- CDN for global delivery
- Video transcoding pipeline (HLS, multiple qualities)
- Caching system with flutter_cache_manager

**Implementation Phases**:
1. **Basic Streaming** (2-3 days): Cloud URLs, network player
2. **Caching & Offline** (1 week): Download manager, storage management
3. **Production** (3-5 days): All videos migrated, analytics

**Cost Example** (50 videos, 1000 users):
- Storage: 5GB √ó $0.015 = $0.075/month
- Egress: 1TB √ó $0 = $0 (Cloudflare R2)
- **Total: ~$0.08/month** vs $120+/month on Firebase
