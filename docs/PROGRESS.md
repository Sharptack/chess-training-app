2. **Beta Testing** (Network - Week 3-4):
   - 20-30 users from personal network
   - Unsupervised home use on tablets
   - Feedback form after each level
   - Analytics on puzzle accuracy, bot win rates, drop-off points

3. **Iteration** (Ongoing):
   - Weekly data review and priority fixes
   - Content adjustments based on difficulty feedback
   - UI improvements for confusion points
   - Balance changes (puzzle difficulty, bot strength)

#### Data Collection
**Quantitative**:
- Level completion rates
- Puzzle accuracy per level
- Bot game win/loss ratios
- Time spent per feature type
- Drop-off points in progression

**Qualitative**:
- User interviews (kids + parents)
- Feedback forms
- Observation notes from supervised play
- Feature requests and pain points

#### Iteration Cycles
