**Branch**: phase-6.5-code-cleanup **Status**: Completed December 2024
**Focus**: Technical debt cleanup and code quality improvements

### Implemented Features

**1. Stockfish Error Handling & Graceful Degradation**
- Added comprehensive error handling to StockfishBot with 5-second initialization timeout
- Implemented automatic fallback to MockBot if Stockfish fails to initialize
- Created `StockfishBotWithFallback` adapter that tries Stockfish first, falls back seamlessly
- Added `isAvailable` and `errorMessage` getters for status checking
- Safe disposal with null checks preventing crashes on cleanup
- All debug statements wrapped in `kDebugMode` checks for production builds
- User never sees errors - transparent recovery maintains gameplay

**2. Extracted Shared Game UI Component**
- Created reusable `GameView` widget eliminating ~150 lines of duplicate code
- Refactored `PlayPage` and `BossPage` to use shared component (54 lines ‚Üí 4 lines each)
- Reduced code duplication by 90% in game display logic
- Consistent UI/UX across Play and Boss modes
- Shared status bar, chess board layout, and game-over handling
- Single source of truth for game interface reduces maintenance burden

**3. Consolidated Constants & Removed Magic Numbers**
- Merged `game_constants.dart` into existing `constants.dart`
- Created `GameConstants` class with 50+ well-documented constants
- Replaced all magic numbers throughout codebase with named constants
- Organized into logical sections:
  * Chess piece values (pawn=1.0, queen=9.0, king=100.0)
  * Move evaluation scores (captureBonus=5.0, checkmateBonus=1000.0)
  * Bot thinking times for all 5 difficulty levels (50ms-1000ms)
  * Stockfish engine settings (timeouts, delays, skill levels)
  * Video progress thresholds (2 seconds=started, 90%=completed)
  * Bot behavior probabilities (capture/check preferences by difficulty)

**4. Fixed State Management Code Smell**
- Replaced hacky `state = null; state = currentState` pattern in providers.dart
- Now uses proper `state = state` to trigger Riverpod StateNotifier listeners
- Cleaner code following StateNotifier best practices
- Maintains same functionality with better architecture

**5. Minor Code Cleanup**
- Fixed hardcoded `requiredGames = 3` in bot_selector_page.dart
- Now reads dynamically from level configuration
- Removed unused `exceptions.dart` file (superseded by ParseFailure from failure.dart)
- Deleted `/core/constants/` folder after merging into single constants file

### Files Created
- `lib/core/widgets/game_view.dart` - Shared game UI component
- `lib/core/constants.dart` - Consolidated app and game constants (merged GameConstants class)

### Files Deleted
- `lib/core/errors/exceptions.dart` - Unused, removed
- `lib/core/constants/game_constants.dart` - Merged into constants.dart

### Files Modified
- `lib/core/game_logic/stockfish_bot.dart` - Error handling + constants (22 replacements)
- `lib/core/game_logic/bot_factory.dart` - Graceful fallback adapter
- `lib/core/game_logic/mock_bot.dart` - Constants (17 replacements)
- `lib/features/play/pages/play_page.dart` - Uses GameView (90% reduction)
- `lib/features/boss/pages/boss_page.dart` - Uses GameView (90% reduction)
- `lib/features/puzzles/pages/puzzles_page.dart` - Computer move delay constant
- `lib/features/play/widgets/bot_selector_page.dart` - Fixed hardcoded games
- `lib/state/providers.dart` - Fixed state management pattern

### Technical Achievements

**Maintainability**:
- Change a constant in ONE place, affects entire app
- Named constants (checkmateBonus) clearer than raw numbers (1000.0)
- Shared UI component means bug fixes apply everywhere
- Reduced code surface area by ~200 lines

**Reliability**:
- Stockfish failures handled gracefully with automatic fallback
- No crashes from engine initialization issues
- Proper state management prevents bugs from missed updates

**DRY Principle**:
- Eliminated 150+ lines of duplicate game UI code
- Single GameView component used in 2 places (expandable to more)
- Constants defined once, used 39 times across codebase

**Developer Experience**:
- Constants are documented with dartdoc comments
- Clear separation between AppConstants and GameConstants
- Easy to adjust game balance by tweaking constant values
- Stockfish fallback makes testing easier (works even if engine broken)

### Known Technical Debt Remaining
- Some nested widget trees could be extracted (puzzles_page.dart)
- Business logic in puzzle validation could move to service class
- No unit tests for bot logic or game state
- Asset paths still hardcoded strings (could be constants)

### Bugs Fixed
‚úÖ Removed debug print statements still present from Phases 1-6
‚úÖ Fixed hardcoded game requirements in bot selector
‚úÖ Fixed state management hack causing code smell
‚úÖ Resolved magic number proliferation throughout codebase

### Testing Performed
‚úÖ App builds successfully with no compilation errors

‚úÖ Boss battles function properly with same UI as Play mode
‚úÖ Puzzles work with 800ms computer move delay
‚úÖ Progress tracking saves/loads correctly across all features
‚úÖ State updates trigger UI rebuilds immediately
‚úÖ Constants work correctly (bot thinking times, evaluation scores)
‚úÖ Stockfish fallback tested (manually forced timeout to verify MockBot takeover)

- Update GameState to initialize from FEN
- UI for selecting/displaying starting position
- Example use cases: endgame practice, opening-specific training

**3. Move Restriction System** üìã (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Add `allowedMoves` or `openingRestriction` to game config
- Restrict legal moves based on desired opening (e.g., Ruy Lopez only)
- Validate moves against restriction rules
- Show hints/feedback when player tries restricted move
- Examples: force specific openings, practice tactical patterns

**4. Terminology Change: "Bots" ‚Üí "Games"** üìù (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Rename throughout UI and code
- `bot_selector_page.dart` ‚Üí `game_selector_page.dart`
- "Play against Bot X" ‚Üí "Play Game X"
- Update JSON: `bots.json` ‚Üí `games.json`
- More accurate terminology for educational games vs AI opponents

**5. Game Controls Enhancement** üéõÔ∏è (HIGH PRIORITY)
- Add **Resign** button to play_page and boss_page
- Add **Undo Move** button (take back last move)
- Show move history panel
- Proper button placement in game UI

**6. Completion Requirements Update** ‚úÖ (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- Change from "must win" to "must play X moves"
- Add `minMovesRequired` field to game config (default: 10)
- Track move count, mark complete if game reaches threshold
- Loss counts as complete if >= 10 moves (or configured value)
- Win always counts as complete regardless of move count
- Update progress tracking logic in providers.dart
- Allows learning from losses, less frustrating for beginners

### Technical Changes Needed

**Data Models**:
```dart
// Bot/Game model enhancements
class Game {  // renamed from Bot
  final String startingFen;  // NEW
  final List<String>? allowedMoves;  // NEW
  final int minMovesForCompletion;  // NEW (default: 10)
  // ... existing fields
}
```

**Game State**:
- Add move counter tracking
- Add move restriction validation
- Add undo functionality
- Add resign handling

**UI Components**:
- Game controls widget (resign/undo buttons)
- Move history display
- Starting position preview
- Restriction indicator

### Files to Create/Modify
- `lib/data/models/game.dart` (renamed from bot.dart)
- `lib/features/play/widgets/game_controls.dart` (NEW)
- `lib/features/play/widgets/game_selector_page.dart` (renamed)
- `lib/features/play/pages/play_page.dart` (add controls)
- `lib/core/game_logic/game_state.dart` (undo, resign, restrictions)
- `lib/state/providers.dart` (update completion logic)
- `assets/data/games.json` (renamed, enhanced schema)

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Riverpod over Bloc**: Better for async data and family providers
- **Hive over SQLite**: Simpler for progress tracking needs
- **JSON over API**: Offline-first, predictable content loading
- **go_router over Navigator**: Type-safe nested routing
- **String provider keys**: Avoids Map instability issues
- **Repository pattern**: Clean separation, testable data layer
- **Chess package integration**: Battle-tested rules over custom implementation ‚úÖ
- **Professional piece graphics**: Essential for kids' app quality ‚úÖ
- **Shared puzzle pool architecture**: Puzzles referenced across levels (future)
- **Multi-move puzzle sequences**: Complex tactics with computer responses ‚úÖ
