- 50%+ return after 3 days
- Sessions per week per user
- Average session length (target: 20-40 min)

**Progress**:
- Lesson/puzzle/game completion rates
- Campaign progression funnel
- Boss battle win rate

**Drop-off**:
- Where users quit (level/campaign)
- Skip rate (video/puzzle/game)
- Feature usage breakdown

**Qualitative**:
- NPS from parents

## Development Workflow

1. Feature branches for each phase (e.g., `phase-7.1-campaign-system`)
2. Test thoroughly before merging to main
3. Update CHANGELOG.md when phase complete
4. Tag releases for major milestones

**Current Branch**: `main` (stable, Phase 7.3 complete)
**Next Branch**: `phase-7.4-content-creation`

## Notes

**Why defer spaced repetition?**
- Focus on getting to real users faster
- Content creation is higher priority
- Spaced repetition requires extensive playtesting to calibrate
- Can add after validating core experience

**Why campaign restructure?**
- More flexibility in level grouping (4-8 levels per campaign vs fixed)
- Reduces boss fatigue (13 bosses vs 55 bosses)
- Cleaner progression model
- Better matches chess curriculum structure

**After LAUNCH_PLAN.md complete:**
- Move Phase 7 summary to CHANGELOG.md
- Delete LAUNCH_PLAN.md (temporary document)
- Work from BACKLOG.md going forward

### Developer utilities

- Repository tree generator: `scripts/update-file-structure.sh` — regenerates `docs/file_structure.txt` from the repository root and overwrites the file.
- Run from the project root:

	```zsh
	scripts/update-file-structure.sh
	```

- This script is useful to keep `docs/file_structure.txt` up-to-date. Consider adding a local pre-commit hook, Makefile target, or CI check to automate this if desired.
