## Development Workflow

1. Feature branches for each phase (e.g., `phase-7.1-campaign-system`)
2. Test thoroughly before merging to main
3. Update CHANGELOG.md when phase complete
4. Tag releases for major milestones

**Current Branch**: `main` (stable, Phase 6.7 complete)
**Next Branch**: `phase-7.1-campaign-system`

## Notes

**Why defer spaced repetition?**
- Focus on getting to real users faster
- Content creation is higher priority
- Spaced repetition requires extensive playtesting to calibrate
- Can add after validating core experience

**Why campaign restructure?**
- More flexibility in level grouping (4-8 levels per campaign vs fixed)
- Reduces boss fatigue (13 bosses vs 55 bosses)
- Cleaner progression model
- Better matches chess curriculum structure

**After LAUNCH_PLAN.md complete:**
- Move Phase 7 summary to CHANGELOG.md
- Delete LAUNCH_PLAN.md (temporary document)
- Work from BACKLOG.md going forward
