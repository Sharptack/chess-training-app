- Test page for chess functionality verification
- Consolidated architecture for chess UI components

### Architecture Implemented:
```
lib/core/
├── game_logic/
│   ├── chess_engine.dart          // Basic chess types, board state
│   └── move_validator.dart        // Simplified move checking
└── widgets/
    └── chess_board_widget.dart    // Reusable interactive chessboard UI
```

### Key Features Working:
- Basic piece movement and turn switching
- Simple move validation preventing obvious illegal moves
- Interactive UI foundation for chess features

### Files Created:
- `lib/core/game_logic/chess_engine.dart` - Basic chess implementation

**Essential for MVP**

### Goals:
- Research and integrate `chess` package (Dart chess engine with full rules)
- Replace custom move validation with battle-tested chess engine
- Maintain existing ChessBoardWidget UI but upgrade the underlying logic
- Add full chess rule support: castling, en passant, pawn promotion, check/checkmate
- Test integration thoroughly before proceeding to puzzles

### Architecture Update:
```
lib/core/
├── game_logic/
│   ├── chess_engine_adapter.dart  // Adapter for chess package
│   └── move_validator.dart        // Wrapper around chess package validation
└── widgets/
    └── chess_board_widget.dart    // Keep existing UI, upgrade backend
```

### Success Criteria:
- All chess rules working correctly (castling, en passant, etc.)
- Check and checkmate detection functional
- Existing UI remains intact but with proper chess validation
- Ready for puzzle implementation

## Phase 2.7: Chess Visual Polish 🎨 HIGH PRIORITY
